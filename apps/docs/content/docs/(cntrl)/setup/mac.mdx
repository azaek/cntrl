<Steps>
<Step>
### Download

Download the Universal DMG from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/azaek/cntrl/releases):

**`Cntrl.Bridge_x.x.x_x64.dmg`** - Works on Intel Macs

</Step>

<Step>
  ### Install 
  1. Open the DMG file 
  2. Drag **Cntrl Bridge** to your **Applications**
  folder
</Step>

<Step>

<Callout type="warn" title="macOS Security Warning">
Since Cntrl Bridge is not notarized with Apple, macOS will block it on first launch with a message like **"Apple could not verify Cntrl Bridge is free of malware"**. This is normal for apps distributed outside the App Store.

To open the app:
1. Try opening **Cntrl Bridge** normally — macOS will block it
2. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
3. Scroll down and click **Open Anyway** next to the Cntrl Bridge message
4. Click **Open** in the confirmation dialog

You only need to do this once — macOS will remember your choice for future launches.

</Steps>

## Configure Settings

After installation, click the menu bar icon to open the dashboard where you can:

- Change the server port
- Enable/disable features
- Configure autostart (toggle "Start on Login")
- Enable power management options (Shutdown, Restart, Sleep)
- Open the configuration file location

All settings are saved to `~/Library/Application Support/com.azaek.cntrl-bridge/config.json`

## Verify It's Working

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:9990/api/status
```

You should see `{"status":"ok"}`.

## macOS Permissions

Certain features require system permissions on macOS. The app will prompt you when these permissions are needed:

<Callout type="warn" title="Required Permissions">
  - **Media Control**: When using `/api/media/*` endpoints, macOS will prompt for **Media
  & Apple Music** access permission. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Media
  & Apple Music** to grant access. - **Process Control**: For `/api/processes/focus` and
  `/api/processes/kill`, you may need to grant **Accessibility** permissions. Go to
  **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility** and add Cntrl Bridge to the
  allowed apps list.
</Callout>

These permissions are only required if you plan to use these specific features.

## macOS Features

- **Menu Bar Integration**: Lives in your menu bar (not the Dock)
- **Universal Binary**: Optimized for both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
- **Tray-Only App**: No Dock icon, stays out of your way
- **Full Feature Parity**: All features work the same as Windows (except Hibernate, which macOS doesn't support)
- **Native Performance**: Fast and efficient with minimal resource usage

<Callout type="info" title="Hibernate on macOS">
  macOS does not have a separate hibernate command. Sleep on Mac automatically uses "Safe
  Sleep" which writes RAM to disk for power loss protection.
</Callout>
