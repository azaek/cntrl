## Static IP Reservation (Important)

If you plan to control your PC from your phone or another device, you need to ensure your computer's address doesn't change over time.

Most home routers assign IP addresses dynamically (DHCP), which means your PC might be `192.168.1.10` today but `192.168.1.15` tomorrow. If that happens, your phone won't be able to find it.

### How to reserve your IP:

1.  Open your router's web interface (usually `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.1`).
2.  Look for a section named **DHCP Server**, **Static IP**, or **Address Reservation**.
3.  Find your computer in the list.
4.  Click **Add** or **Reserve** to bind your computer's physical (MAC) address to a specific IP address.

  Once reserved, you can always reach your computer at the same address, making it a
  reliable "Static" endpoint for your remote dashboards.
