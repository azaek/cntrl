First off, thank you for considering contributing to Cntrl Bridge!

## Philosophy

Before you dive in, please keep in mind the project's core philosophy:

- **Simple**: We want to keep the feature set focused.
- **Lightweight**: Avoid adding heavy dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
- **Cross-Platform Native**: We prioritize a clean, native experience on both Windows and macOS.

## Getting Started

To work on Cntrl Bridge locally, you'll need:

- **Rust** (latest stable) - Install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)
- **Node.js 18+** - For frontend and documentation
- **Platform-specific tools:**
  - **Windows**: Visual Studio Build Tools
  - **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/azaek/cntrl.git
   cd cntrl/bridge
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run tauri dev
   ```

4. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run tauri build
   ```

This will create platform-specific installers in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`

## Documentation

The documentation is built with [Fuma Docs](https://fumadocs.dev). To run it locally:

```bash
cd docs
npm run dev
```

## Pull Requests

- **Small is better**: We prefer small, focused pull requests.
- **Explain the "Why"**: Include a clear description of the problem your PR solves.
- **Consistency**: Try to follow the existing code style.

Thank you for being part of the community! 🚀
