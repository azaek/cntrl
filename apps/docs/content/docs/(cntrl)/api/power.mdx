The power endpoints allow you to remotely control your computer's power state, including shutdown, restart, sleep, and hibernate.

## Endpoints

### System Controls

All power endpoints accept a `POST` request and return the same success response.

```http
POST /api/pw/shutdown
POST /api/pw/restart
POST /api/pw/sleep
POST /api/pw/hibernate
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "success"
}
```

## Configuration

Power commands can be enabled or disabled in your `config.json`:

```json title="config.json"
{
  "features": {
    "enable_sleep": true,
    "enable_restart": true,
    "enable_shutdown": true,
    "enable_hibernate": true
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  By default, **shutdown** and **restart** are disabled for safety. Sleep and hibernate
  are enabled. You can toggle them individually in the configuration file or through the
  Cntrl Bridge dashboard settings.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn" title="Security">
  These endpoints perform system-level actions. Ensure your Cntrl server is only
  accessible on your trusted local network.
</Callout>
