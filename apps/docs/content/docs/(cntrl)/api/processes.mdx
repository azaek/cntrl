<Callout type="success" title="Introducing Process Control Actions">
  Added `launch`, `focus`, and `kill` actions to the Processes API.
</Callout>

The Processes API allows you to monitor running applications and perform actions like focusing windows or terminating processes.

<Callout type="info">
  To use these endpoints, ensure `enable_processes: true` is set in your configuration.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn" title="macOS Permissions Required">
  On macOS, using `/api/processes/focus` or `/api/processes/kill` requires
  **Accessibility** permissions. When you first use these features, macOS may prompt you
  to grant access. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility** and add
  Cntrl Bridge to the allowed apps list.
</Callout>

## Endpoints

### Get Process List (Aggregated)

Returns a list of top memory-consuming processes, aggregated by name. This is useful for general monitoring.

```http
GET /api/processes
```

**Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "name": "chrome.exe",
    "count": 12,
    "memory": 4294967296,
    "memory_mb": 4096.0,
    "cpu_time": 120.5
  },
  {
    "name": "Code.exe",
    "count": 5,
    "memory": 2147483648,
    "memory_mb": 2048.0,
    "cpu_time": 45.2
  }
]
```

---

### Get Process Details (By Name)

Get detailed information about all running instances of a specific process, including PIDs and window titles.

```http
GET /api/processes/{name}
```

**Parameters:**

- `name` (path): The name of the process (e.g., `notepad.exe`).

**Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "pid": 1234,
    "name": "notepad.exe",
    "title": "Untitled - Notepad",
    "has_window": true,
    "memory": 15482880,
    "cpu": 0.0
  },
  {
    "pid": 5678,
    "name": "notepad.exe",
    "title": "",
    "has_window": false,
    "memory": 4096000,
    "cpu": 0.0
  }
]
```

---

### Focus Process Window

Attempts to bring the main window of a specific process to the foreground. This is useful for switching context on the remote machine.

```http
POST /api/processes/focus
```

**Body:**

```json
{
  "pid": 1234
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "success"
}
```

<Callout type="warn" title="Platform Requirements">
This endpoint relies on the OS window manager. It works best for processes with visible windows (`has_window: true`).

**macOS**: Requires **Accessibility** permissions (see note above).

</Callout>

---

### Kill Process

Terminate one or more processes. You can kill a specific PID or all instances of a process name.

```http
POST /api/processes/kill
```

<Callout type="info" title="macOS Note">
  On macOS, terminating processes may require **Accessibility** permissions (see note
  above).
</Callout>

**Body (Kill Single PID):**

```json
{
  "pid": 1234
}
```

**Body (Kill All by Name):**

```json
{
  "name": "notepad.exe"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "count": 1
}
```

The `count` field indicates how many processes were terminated.

---

### Launch Process

Start a new application or script on the host machine.

```http
POST /api/processes/launch
```

**Body (Windows Examples):**

```json
// Launch Notepad
{
  "path": "notepad.exe"
}

// Launch Spotify (via Protocol)
{
  "path": "cmd",
  "args": ["/C", "start", "spotify:"]
}
```

**Body (macOS Examples):**

```json
// Launch TextEdit
{
  "path": "open",
  "args": ["-a", "TextEdit"]
}

// Launch Spotify
{
  "path": "open",
  "args": ["-a", "Spotify"]
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "success"
}
```

<Callout type="tip" title="Real-Time Process List">
  For real-time updates, use the [WebSocket API](/docs/ws/processes). Subscribe to the
  `processes` topic and receive `process_list` events automatically. You can also send
  kill/launch commands and receive feedback through the same connection.
</Callout>

## Example Usage Scenarios

### 1. Remote Task Manager

Create a dashboard that lists top resource-hogging applications.

1. Call `GET /api/processes` to get the top list.
2. Display them in a table.
3. If a user clicks "End Task" on "chrome.exe":
4. Call `POST /api/processes/kill` with `{"name": "chrome.exe"}` to close all instances.

### 2. App Launcher & Switcher

Build a control panel for your favorite apps.

1. **Launch**: Use `POST /api/processes/launch` to start an app.
2. **Switch**: Check if the app is running via `GET /api/processes/spotify.exe`.
3. If running, iterate through the list to find the instance with `has_window: true`.
4. Call `POST /api/processes/focus` with its PID to bring Spotify to the front.

### 3. "Boss Mode" / Panic Button

Instantly close distracting apps.

1. Define a list of apps to close (e.g., games, browsers).
2. When the button is pressed, cycle through the list.
3. Call `POST /api/processes/kill` with `{"name": "game.exe"}` for each one.
