Cntrl Bridge has a built-in updater that checks for new versions automatically. When an update is available, an **Update Available** button appears in the footer of the app next to the version number.

Click the button to download and install the update. The app will restart automatically once the update is applied.

  Your settings are **not** touched during updates. Configuration files are preserved across all update methods.

## Release Channels

Cntrl Bridge supports two release channels:
