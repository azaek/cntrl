<Callout type="warn" title="Public Alpha">
  Cntrl Bridge is currently in early development (v0.x). Features and API endpoints are
  subject to **breaking changes** without major version increments.
</Callout>

A lightweight system tray app that exposes your PC as a controllable API - monitor stats, control media, manage processes, and trigger power actions from any device
on your network.

Built with **Rust** and **Tauri**, it provides native performance with minimal resource usage. It was designed for personal use and for people who enjoy building their own dashboards or remote control setups.

### Philosophy

- **Lightweight**: Minimal memory footprint (~20MB) using native system WebView
- **Fast**: Rust-powered backend for maximum performance
- **Transparent**: What you see in the tray is what is running. No hidden services.

### Key Features

- **System Monitoring**: Access CPU load, GPU temperature, RAM usage, and Disk space via a simple JSON API.
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket API with lazy-spawned loops - zero CPU overhead when idle.
- **Media Control**: Control playback, volume, and see what's playing on any media app.
- **Process Management**: View running processes, kill memory hogs, and launch apps remotely.
- **Power Management**: Remotely Shutdown, Restart, or put your computer to Sleep.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows and macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon).
- **Tray-Only App**: Lives in your system tray/menu bar, no taskbar clutter.
- **Native Performance**: Rust-powered backend with minimal resource usage (~20MB).

<Callout type="warn" title="No Built-in Encryption">
