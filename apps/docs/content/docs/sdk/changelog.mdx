## 0.1.1

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed WebSocket subscriptions being overridden when multiple hooks subscribe to different topics.
- Fixed duplicate WebSocket connections when multiple hooks trigger connect in the same render.
- Fixed manual disconnect causing reconnect loop from hooks with `auto` connection mode.

### Features

- Added pluggable storage layer via `BridgesProvider` `persistence` prop. See [Custom Storage](/docs/sdk/custom-persistence).
- Added `persistenceStatus` (`"idle"` | `"loading"` | `"error"`) and `persistenceError` to `useBridges()` for tracking custom storage layer state.
- Added `isCustomStorage` boolean to `useBridges()` to detect whether a custom storage layer is active.
- Unified error handling: `onError` callback now receives `SdkError` — a discriminated union (`BridgeWsError | PersistenceOperationError`) with a `source` field. See [Error Types](/docs/sdk/getting-started#error-types).

## 0.1.0

Initial release.

- React hooks for real-time system stats, media control, process management, and power control.
- WebSocket-first architecture with automatic reconnection and exponential backoff.
- Zustand store with localStorage persistence.
- Multi-bridge support with per-bridge WebSocket connections.
- TanStack Query integration for caching and deduplication.
- Connection modes: `auto`, `passive`, `eager`.
- Low-level `BridgeClient` for non-React usage.
